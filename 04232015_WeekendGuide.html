		<div>Cost: FREE!</div>
		<div>You may remember we introduced you to free weekly yoga on Race St. Pier in a previous Weekend Guide. Now you can get your fix closer to campus, on a river that’s much nearer by. Yay for less exercise needed to get your exercise! BYO mat, towel and water bottle. The classes are pay–what–you–can, so they can be pretty cheap (or even free if you’re feeling particularly stingy).</div>
		<div>Where: Arch 108</div>
		<div>Where: Houston Hall of Flags</div>
		<div>Drexel Academy of Natural Sciences (near Logan Square), Friday noon–6 p.m., Saturday and Sunday 10 a.m.–5 p.m.</div>
		<div>Cost: FREE!</div>
		<div>Like the Philly Flower Show, But Cheaper</div>
		<div>WHERE & WHEN:</div>
		<div>EVENTS</div>
		<div>Go Because: Regardless of where you’re from, one thing we can all agree on is that we all love food and music. Experience the global community at Penn through food and cultural performances.</div>
		<div>In case you didn’t want to shell out 20 bucks for the Philadelphia Flower Show a few weeks ago, save $4 and check out Drexel’s Orchid Show and Sale at their Academy of Natural Sciences. A ticket will get you access to the impressive flower arrangements — and provide you with your #insta of the day. Then you can stay for the lectures on native species and growing orchids, which might be valuable information if you decide to impulse buy one to liven up your dorm room.</div>
		<div></div>
		<div>When: Friday 4/24 8:00pm</div>
		<div>The Story: All Penn students were asked via email to participate in a survey to gauge the sexual assault climate of the University.
</div>
		<div>Turnt up, citations down</div>
		<div>The Pennchants: The Other Direction</div>
		<div>PennYo: Sherlock Yolmes</div>
		<div>The Stats: Citations for alcohol decreased over 94 percent since last year. Last Fling, 35 citations were issued, while for this year, there were only two given for underage drinking.</div>
		<div>TOP STORIES</div>
		<div>Penn's Premier Chinese A Cappella Group, PennYo, presents Spring 2015 concert, Sherlock Yolmes! Come join Detective Yolmes and his trusted sidekick Jane Watson as they race against the clock to solve the mystery of the golden pitch pipe and face their arch-nemesis James Moriarty.</div>
		<div>Waitlisted students: Penn’s just not that into you</div>
		<div>Penn students neglect to fill out Sexual Response Assault Climate Survey</div>
		<div>Nom Stop Street Food Festival</div>
		<div>Go Because: It will be a night of mystery, humor, and Asian pop music!</div>
		<div>The Story: Dean of Admissions Eric Furda strives to let applicants down easy by waitlisting instead of rejecting them even though they have little chance of being admitted.</div>
		<div>Where: Harold Prince Theatre</div>
		<div>WEEKEND GUIDE</div>
		<div>At Fling, students lose more than their dignity</div>
		<div>When: Friday, 4/24 5:30 PM - 7:30 PM ; Saturday, 4/25 9:00 PM - 11:00 PM</div>
		<div>The Lowdown: At a Friday party at Sigma Alpha Mu, four students had their phones stolen.</div>
		<div>Cost: $8 presale, $10 at door; $7 for groups of 15 or more</div>
		<div>The Failure: Despite the fact that Amy Gutmann is the chair of the Association of American Universities which administered the survey, a mere 25 percent of the student body took the time to complete it. Apparently, the $5 Amazon gift card awarded to the participants was not a large enough incentive.</div>
		<div>Hey, freshmen (who really just don’t count as freshmen anymore. It’s April, guys)! Tomorrow the Philadelphia Healthy Food Truck Initiative is hosting an event where you can get a bagel from Schmear It, soup from Chez Yasmine and a cookie from Magic Carpet, completely free. Sign up via Facebook — just type “Freshman Food Truck Tours” into the search bar and follow the link. It’s the perfect way to avoid using up those last couple (or eighty) meal swipes.</div>
		<div>Why it's disappointing for the administration: With such a low turnout for the survey, the results cannot be considered valid.</div>
		<div>Food trucks in various spots around campus, Friday 12:30 p.m. to 2:00 p.m.</div>
		<div>Free Food for Frosh</div>
		<div>Why Amy G’s breathing a sigh of relief: Penn police claimed that the Penn student body complied with all University regulations and minimal physical damage on campus was reported as a result.</div>
		<div>Rationale: Furda explains that if Penn chooses not to admit students from a particular high school, he will simply waitlist them in order to keep that relationship intact.</div>
		<div>Glimmer of Hope: Although being on the waitlist often presents a poor prospect of being admitted, students are encouraged to maintain relationships with the schools they applied to by updating them with any recent accomplishments.</div>
		<div>You might not have gone for a run in a few days (read: years), but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t care about the Penn Relays. With events running (pun intended) pretty much all day, all weekend long and with free tickets available with a PennCard, there’s no reason you shouldn’t drop by the track to check it out. Highlights: Don’t miss Philly elementary schoolers tearing up the track in shuttle relays from 12:30 p.m. to 2 p.m. on Friday. The biggest event of the weekend is held on Saturday, with runners representing ‘Murica taking on different countries. Men’s and Women’s USA vs. the World 4x400s take place between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m. Find the rest of the schedule online at pennrelaysonline.com.</div>

		<div>Why they didn't just drop them: A student who was a victim of the burglary said she felt the phone slip out of her purse. Later the phone had been turned off, preventing her from locating it.</div>
		<div>Where: Iron Gate Theater</div>
		<div>As Penn students, we’re constantly searching for direction. Direction for our lives, direction for our dreams, direction to our next food source.
